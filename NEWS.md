# statip 0.2.0

* Function 'picor()' added for univariate piecewise-constant regression. 


# statip 0.1.9

* Function 'bandwidth()' added. 
* Function 'if_else()' from package 'dplyr' is no longer used since it 
currently inconsistently transforms a matrix into a vector; the base 'ifelse()' 
is used instead. 


# statip 0.1.8

* Function 'predict.kmeans()' added (with dependency to package 'clue').


# statip 0.1.6

* '...' argument added in 'mfv()' and 'mfv1()' (useful for the subsequent call
of these functions within package 'modeest'). 


# statip 0.1.5

* 'mfv()' was not working with factors.


# statip 0.1.4

* Change 'mfv()' to better take account of missing values. 


# statip 0.1.3

* Update authors list. 


# statip 0.1.2

* Small updates before CRAN submission. 


# statip 0.1.1

* Functions 'mfv()' and 'mfv1()' for the mode (most frequent value) 
found in a vector.
